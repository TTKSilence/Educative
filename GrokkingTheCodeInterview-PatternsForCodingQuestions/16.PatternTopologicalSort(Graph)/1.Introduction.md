**Topological Sort** is used to find a linear ordering of elements that have dependencies on each other. For example, if event 'B' is dependent on event 'A','A' comes before 'B' in topological ordering.

This pattern defines an easy way to understand the technique for performing topological sorting of a set of elements and then solves a few problems using it.

**Source**: Any node that has no incoming edge and has only outgoing edges is called a source.

**Sink**: Any node that has only incoming edges and no outgoing edges is called a sink.

A topological ordering is possible only when the graph has no directed cycles.

To find the topological sort of a graph, we can traverse the graph in a **BFS** way. Start with all the sources, and in a stepwise fashion, save all sources to a sorted list. We will then remove all sources and their edges from the graph. After the removal of the edges, we will have new sources, so we will repeat the above process until all vertices are visited.

Implementation:
1. Initialization;
2. Build the graph and find in-degrees of all vertices;
3. Find all sources;
4. Sort.
