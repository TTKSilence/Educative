This pattern is based on the **Depth First Search(DFS)** technique to traverse a tree.
**Recursion** (or a **stack** for the iterative approach) will be used to keep track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. This also means that the space complexity of the algorithm will be O(H), where 'H' is the maximum height of the tree.
