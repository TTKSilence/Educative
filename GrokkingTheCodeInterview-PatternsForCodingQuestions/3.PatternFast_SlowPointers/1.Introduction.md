Problem Descirpiton:
**The Fast&Slow Pointer approach**, AKA **the Hare&Tortoise Algorithm**, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/ LinkedList) **at different speeds**. This approach is quite useful when dealing with **cyclic LinkedLists or arrays**.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are **bound to meet**. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

One of the famous problems solved using this method is **Finding a cycle in a LinkedList**.
