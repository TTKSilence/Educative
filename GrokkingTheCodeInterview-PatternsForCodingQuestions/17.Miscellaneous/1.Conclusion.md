Theoretically, the **Median of Medians** algorithm gives the best time complexity of O(N) but practically both the **Median of Medians** and the **Randomized Partitioning** algorithms nearly perform equally.

In the context of **Quicksort**, given an O(N) selection algorithm using the **Median of Medians**, one can use it to find the ideal pivot (the median) at every step of quicksort, and thus produce a sorting algorithm with O(NlogN) running time in the worst-case. Though practical implementations of this variant are considerably slower on average, they are of theoretical interest beacuse they show that an optimal selection algorithm can yield an optimal sorting algorithm.
