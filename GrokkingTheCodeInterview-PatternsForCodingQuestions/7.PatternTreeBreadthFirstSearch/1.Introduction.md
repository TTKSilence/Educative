Any problem involving the traversal of a tree in a level-by-level order can be efficiently solved using **Breadth First Search (BFS)** approach.

A **Queue** will be used to keep track of all the nodes of a level before jumping onto the next level. This also means that space complexity of the algorithm will be O(W), where 'W' is the maximum number of nodes on any level.
