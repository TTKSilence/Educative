XOR is alogical bitwise operator that returns 0 (false) if both bits are the same and returns 1(true) otherwise. In other words, it only returns 1 if exactly one bit is set to 1 out of the two bits in comparison.

It is surprising to know the approaches that the XOR operator enables us to solve certain problems.

x^x=0
x^0=x
(a^b)^c=a^(b^c) —— Associative
a^b=b^a —— Commutative
