Problem pattern:
For problems dealing with **an arrayï¼ˆor a LinkedList)**, 
something among **all** the **contiguous subarrays (or sublists)** of **a given size** need to be found out or calculated.

Time complexity:
Before:
For every element of the input array, the sum of its next 'K' elements will be calculated.
Therefore, the time complexity should be **O(N*K)**.

After:
To visualize each contiguous subarray as a sliding window, we just slide the window by one element when we need to move on to the next subarray.
During the slide, we substract the left element of the window and add the right one, the central elements will be reused.
Thus, the time complexity should be **O(N)**.
