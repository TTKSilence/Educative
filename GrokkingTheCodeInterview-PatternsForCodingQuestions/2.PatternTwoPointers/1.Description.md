Problem description:
For the problems dealing with **sorted arrrays (or LinkedLists)** and need to find **a set of elements** that fulfill **certain constraints**, the Two Pointer approach can be effective.
The set of elements could be **a pair, a triplet or even a subarray**.


Time complexity:
Before:
Considering each element one by one (the first pointer) and iterate through the remaining elements (the second pointer) to find elements that can fulfill the constraints together.
Time complexity: **O(N^2)**

After:
Given that the input array is sorted, considering using two pointers at the same time, for example, one in the beginning and another at the end. At each step, check out if the current elements fulfill teh constraints. If not, move one of the pointers according to the comparation result.
Thus, we only moved and calculated at most N times till we get the final result.
Time complexity: **O(N)**
