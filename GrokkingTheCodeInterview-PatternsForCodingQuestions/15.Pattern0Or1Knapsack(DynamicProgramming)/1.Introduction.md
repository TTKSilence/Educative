**0/1 Knapsack** parttern is based on the famous problem with the same name which is efficiently solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

In this pattern, a brute-force recursive solution to see the overlapping subproblems will always be introduced firstly, to realize that the same problems are solving repeatedly.

After the recursive solution, the algorithm will be modified to apply advanced techniques of **Memoization** and **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming** to develop a complete understanding of this pattern.

Given the weights and profits of 'N' items, put these items in a knapsack which has a capacity 'C'. The goal is to get the maximum profit out of the items in the knapsack. Each item can only be selected once, as there aren't multiple quantities of any items.
